## :beginner: About

Silent Payment Indexer is a service designed to efficiently index and organize Bitcoin silent payment data, simplifying the process of receiving silent payments for wallets and applications. By providing a reliable and performant indexing solution, this project aims to also accelerate the adoption of silent payments on the Bitcoin network.

Read more about silent payments in [BIP 352](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458) and [Ruben Somsen's post](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/c43b79517e7cb701ebf77eec6dbb46b8).

## :station: Features

-   **Efficient Indexing:** Processes Bitcoin blocks to extract silent payment data.
-   **Structured Data Storage:** Stores indexed data for easy retrieval.
-   **API Queries:** Enables applications to search for specific silent payment information.
-   **Continuous Updates:** Maintains data freshness by indexing new blocks.

## :electric_plug: Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/Bitshala-Incubator/silent-pay-indexer.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
  $ cd silent-pay-indexer
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
  $ npm install
```

> **Note:** If you encounter `gyp` or `sqlite3` build errors, please check your Node.js version. Proceeding with Node.js v18 or v20 LTS is recommended to use prebuilt binaries.

### :notebook: Prerequisites

-   **Node.js** (v18 or v20 LTS recommended. Newer versions like v22 may fail to install `sqlite3` without C++ build tools)
-   **Bitcoin Node** - Choose one:
    -   [Polar](https://lightningpolar.com/) (Recommended - easiest setup)
    -   Docker (see setup instructions below)
    -   Bitcoin Core (manual installation)

### :wrench: Configuration

#### Option 1: Using Polar (Recommended)

[Polar](https://lightningpolar.com/) is a one-click Bitcoin and Lightning network for local development with a visual interface.

1. **Download and Install Polar**
   - Visit https://lightningpolar.com/
   - Download and install for your operating system
   - Launch Polar

2. **Create a Bitcoin Network**
   - Open Polar and click **"Create Network"**
   - Set **Network Name**: `silent-pay-dev` (or any name)
   - Set **Bitcoin Nodes**: `1`
   - Set **Lightning Nodes**: `0` (not needed)
   - Click **"Create Network"**

3. **Start the Network**
   - Click the **Start** button (▶) in Polar
   - Wait for the Bitcoin node to turn green (running)
   - Click on the Bitcoin node to view RPC credentials

4. **Get RPC Credentials**
   - In Polar, select your Bitcoin Core node
   - Find the **Connect/Info/RPC** tab
   - Note the credentials:
     - RPC Host: `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
     - RPC Port: `18443` (regtest default)
     - RPC User: (shown in Polar, usually `polaruser`)
     - RPC Password: (shown in Polar, usually `polarpass`)

5. **Mine Initial Blocks**
   - In Polar, click **"Mine Blocks"**
   - Enter `100` blocks
   - Click **"Mine"** to create blockchain data

6. **Create Development Config**

```bash
$ cd config
$ cp example.config.yaml dev.config.yaml
```

Update `config/dev.config.yaml` with your Polar credentials:

```yaml
db:
  path: '~/.silent-pay-indexer/db/database.sqlite'
  synchronize: true  # Auto-create tables in dev mode

app:
  port: 80
  verbose: false
  debug: true
  network: regtest  # Must match Polar (regtest)
  requestRetry:
    delay: 500
    count: 3

providerType: BITCOIN_CORE_RPC

bitcoinCore:
  protocol: http
  rpcHost: 127.0.0.1          # No http:// prefix!
  rpcPass: polarpass           # From Polar UI
  rpcUser: polaruser           # From Polar UI
  rpcPort: 18443               # From Polar UI

throttler:
  ttl: 1000
  limit: 5

cache:
  ttl: 5000
```

**Important Notes:**
- `rpcHost` should be just the hostname (`127.0.0.1`), NOT the full URL
- `dev.config.yaml` is in `.gitignore` - it's machine-specific
- Verify credentials match what Polar displays

#### Option 2: Using Docker Compose

1. **Start Bitcoin Core with Docker**

```bash
$ docker compose -f "./e2e/helpers/docker/docker-compose.yml" up -d
```

This starts a Bitcoin Core regtest node with:
- RPC Port: `18443`
- RPC User: `polaruser`
- RPC Password: `password`

2. **Create Development Config**

```bash
$ cd config
$ cp example.config.yaml dev.config.yaml
```

Update `config/dev.config.yaml`:

```yaml
db:
  path: '~/.silent-pay-indexer/db/database.sqlite'
  synchronize: true

app:
  port: 80
  network: regtest
  # ... other settings

providerType: BITCOIN_CORE_RPC

bitcoinCore:
  protocol: http
  rpcHost: 127.0.0.1
  rpcPass: password      # Docker default
  rpcUser: polaruser     # Docker default
  rpcPort: 18443
```

3. **Verify Bitcoin Node is Running**

```bash
$ docker ps
```

You should see `silent-pay-bitcoind` container running.

#### Option 3: Manual Bitcoin Core Installation

1. Download Bitcoin Core from https://bitcoi  ncore.org/
2. Create `bitcoin.conf` in your Bitcoin data directory:

```ini
regtest=1
server=1
rpcuser=youruser
rpcpassword=yourpassword
rpcport=18443
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
txindex=1
```

3. Start Bitcoin Core with `-regtest` flag
4. Update `config/dev.config.yaml` with your credentials

#### Environment Variable Overrides

You can override any config value using environment variables:

```bash
# Override specific values
$ APP_PORT=3000 npm run start:dev
$ DB_PATH="C:/custom/path/db.sqlite" npm run start:dev

# Override RPC credentials
$ BITCOIN_CORE_RPC_USER=myuser BITCOIN_CORE_RPC_PASS=mypass npm run start:dev
```

Variable naming: `SECTION_KEY` in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- `db.path` → `DB_PATH`
- `bitcoinCore.rpcPort` → `BITCOIN_CORE_RPC_PORT`
- `app.port` → `APP_PORT`

### :rocket: Running the Application

1. **Ensure Bitcoin Node is Running**
   - Polar: Network should be started (green status)
   - Docker: Container should be running
   - Manual: Bitcoin Core should be running with `-regtest`

2. **Start the Indexer**

```bash
$ npm run start:dev
```

**What happens:**
- Loads `config/dev.config.yaml` (because `NODE_ENV=dev`)
- Connects to your Bitcoin node via RPC
- Creates database tables automatically (`synchronize: true`)
- Starts HTTP server on configured port (default: 80)
- Begins indexing blocks from your Bitcoin node

**Other commands:**
```bash
$ npm run build              # Build for production
$ npm run start:prod         # Run in production mode
$ npm run test               # Run unit tests
$ npm run test:e2e          # Run end-to-end tests
```

3. **Verify It's Working**
   - Check logs for successful startup:
     ```
     [Nest] LOG [NestApplication] Nest application successfully started
     [Nest] LOG [RouterExplorer] Mapped {/silent-block/latest-height, GET} route
     [Nest] LOG [IndexerService] Starting indexer...
     ```
   - **API Endpoints:**
     - Swagger Documentation: `http://localhost/api`
     - Latest Block Height: `http://localhost/silent-block/latest-height`
     - Query Transactions: `http://localhost/transactions/{scan_pubkey}`
   - Watch the logs as new blocks are indexed

4. **Mine More Blocks (Optional)**
   - In Polar: Use the "Mine Blocks" button
   - With Docker: 
     ```bash
     $ docker exec silent-pay-bitcoind bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcuser=polaruser -rpcpassword=password generatetoaddress 10 <address>
     ```

### :bug: Troubleshooting

**Error: `ECONNREFUSED` to localhost:18443**
- ✅ Ensure Bitcoin node is running (check Polar/Docker)
- ✅ Verify `rpcHost` is `127.0.0.1` (no protocol prefix)
- ✅ Verify `rpcPort`, `rpcUser`, and `rpcPass` match your node

**Error: `SqliteError: no such table`**
- ✅ Set `db.synchronize: true` in `config/dev.config.yaml`
- ✅ Delete database and restart: `rm -rf ~/.silent-pay-indexer/db/`

**Error: `gyp ERR!` during npm install**
- ✅ Use Node.js v18 or v20 LTS (not v22+)
- ✅ Install build tools (Windows: Visual Studio Build Tools)

**Port 80 already in use**
- ✅ Change `app.port` to `3000` in config
- ✅ Or use: `APP_PORT=3000 npm run start:dev`
