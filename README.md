## :beginner: About

Silent Payment Indexer is a service designed to efficiently index and organize Bitcoin silent payment data, simplifying the process of receiving silent payments for wallets and applications. By providing a reliable and performant indexing solution, this project aims to also accelerate the adoption of silent payments on the Bitcoin network.

Read more about silent payments in [BIP 352](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458) and [Ruben Somsen's post](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/c43b79517e7cb701ebf77eec6dbb46b8).

## :station: Features

-   **Efficient Indexing:** Processes Bitcoin blocks to extract silent payment data.
-   **Structured Data Storage:** Stores indexed data for easy retrieval.
-   **API Queries:** Enables applications to search for specific silent payment information.
-   **Continuous Updates:** Maintains data freshness by indexing new blocks.
